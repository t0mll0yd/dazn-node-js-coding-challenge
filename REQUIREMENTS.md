## Node.js Coding Challenge

#### Functional Requirements

Build a service in Node.js that exposes an API which can be consumed from any client.
This service must check how many video streams a given user is watching and prevent a user
watching more than 3 video streams concurrently.

#### Output Package Requirements

The solution has to be provided as a Git repository including full commit history.
Please follow the frequent commit practice so that your local repository indicates
reasonable milestones of your implementation.

You are more than welcome to share your repository on a free service such as GitHub or BitBucket.

The repository MUST contain:

-	Source code
- 	It should be buildable/viewable
- 	In case you need to use external libraries, please add them
-	Any installation and deployment instructions for apps and components
-	README file with URL for testing the service online and a brief explanation on the scalability strategy

#### Rules
If you do not complete the test please indicate how you would intend to finalize in the README. 
You can use any library or tool you feel comfortable with but as few frameworks as possible.
